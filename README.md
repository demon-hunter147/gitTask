# gitTask

## This is my basic Git Task for my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp for [HyperionDev](http://hyperiondev.com)

**The point of this task is to prove competency in using Git and [GitHub](http://github.com)!**

The helloWorld.js file in the repository is used to gather a user's input in a browser and then prints this into an alert in the browser's window, in order to show the user what they entered.

### Installation
Clone the repo in the usual manner and you will be able to simply open the helloWorld.js file from there.
The file can then be included into a project by linking it as a JavaScript script in your HTML document 

(e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="../scripts/helloWorld.js"></script>)

### Usage
1. Once the file has been included in your HTML document, you can simply call the methods in the file in whichever way you may require it (i.e. through another function, on the click of a button, or upon opening the webpage).
1. On triggering or using the the userIput variable, you will be prompted in the browser to enter something into a field.
1. Once the data has been typed, the data is used to alert the user in the browser window, stating exactly what they typed.

#### Example:
! [helloWorld in Action](/images/helloWorld in Action.jpg)

This is all my own work!
